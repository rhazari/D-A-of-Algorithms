The task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, 
where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.

In line #4: Change the SIZE to the total number in the text file.
IntegerArray.txt contains 100000 numbers, so
#define SIZE 100000.

The program generates an output file which sorts the numbers 
from the input text file using merge sort.
