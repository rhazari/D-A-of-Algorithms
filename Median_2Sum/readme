twoSum.c : Implementation of the two sum algorithm
    The task is to compute the number of target values t in the interval [2500,4000] (inclusive) 
    such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t.
    
median.c : Implementation of the median maintenance problem
    The text file "Median.txt" contains a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order;
    Treat this as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one. 
    Letting xi denote the ith number of the file, the kth median mk is defined as the median of the numbers x1,…,xk. 
    (So, if k is odd, then mk is ((k+1)/2)th smallest number among x1,…,xk; 
    if k is even, then mk is the (k/2)th smallest number among x1,…,xk.)
