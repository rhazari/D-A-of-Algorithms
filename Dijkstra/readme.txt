The task is to run Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on this graph, 
using 1 as the source vertex, and to compute the shortest-path distances between 1 and every other vertex of the graph. 
If there is no path between a vertex v and vertex 1, we'll define the shortest-path distance between 1 and v to be 1000000.

Report the shortest-path distances to the following ten vertices, in order: 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197
